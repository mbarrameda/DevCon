This is our GDD for our Development Contract

Desired Game Mechanic: 2D platformer-type game with a gravity flip mechanic. The player would have to solve puzzles and challenges by applying gravity to change how you traverse the level. Through gravity, the player will be able to walk along the walls and the ceilings.

Objective Statement: Create a 2D platformer where players must solve puzzles and navigate levels by flipping gravity, enabling them to walk on walls and ceilings.

Design Rationale: We want the player to feel challenged throughout the gameplay experience. As the player progresses through the created levels, they will feel a sense of urgency to complete the puzzle/challenge. The player will also feel empowered because of their ability to change their gravity movement. The game will focus on giving a sense of disorientation, followed by a satisfying moment when a puzzle or obstacle is conquered through an unexpected gravity shift. 

This mechanic/experience is innovative because it expands the movement mechanics. The 4-way gravity flip will add a new dimension to player navigation, allowing for a more complex level design and player freedom.
